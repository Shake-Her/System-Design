## What is Design pattern?

- A design pattern provides a general reusable solution for the common problems that occur in software design. The pattern typically shows relationships and interactions between classes or objects. The idea is to speed up the development process by providing well-tested, proven development/design paradigms. Design patterns are programming language independent strategies for solving a common problem. That means a design pattern represents an idea, not a particular implementation. By using design patterns, you can make your code more flexible, reusable, and maintainable.

**Goal:**

- Understand the purpose and usage of each design pattern in order to pick and implement the correct pattern as needed.

## Why and when should we use Design Patterns?

- Design Patterns exists to help us, developers. They enable us to implement tried and tested solutions (that is also used by other developers) to known problems, this way saving time and effort during the implementation of the code. They also define common words to talk about specific problems, making it easier to communicate, for example, you could say "you can use a factory in this case", and other developers will know what they need to do.

- Sometimes you do not need a design pattern, and this is good to keep in mind, we should just use it when it's necessary. Each design pattern can be used for a specific situation, and that's one of the reasons why it's important to know about them, because you can have a problem that is a known problem in the software development world and already exists a good solution to solve it, by using a design pattern. This way you do not need to 'reinvent the wheel', you can just use something that already exists and works well. So the best way to know when you should use it or not, it's to learn them and understand which problem each design pattern solve.

### What are the types of design patterns?

There are three types of design patterns. They are:

- Creational Patterns: These patterns provide freedom of choice between creating objects by hiding the logic. The objects constructed are decoupled from the implemented system. Some of the examples of creational patterns are - Factory design pattern, Builder design, Prototype design, Singleton design, Abstract Factory design.
- Structural Patterns: These patterns help in defining how the structures of classes and objects should be like for defining the composition between classes, interfaces and objects. Some of the examples of structural patterns are - Adaptor design, Facade design, Decorator design, proxy design etc.
- Behavioural Patterns: These patterns help to define how the objects should communicate and interact with one another. Some of the examples of behavioural patterns are - Command pattern, Iterator pattern, Observer pattern, Strategy pattern, etc.

The following diagram represents the summary of the types of design patterns.

- The elements of a Design Pattern

- **A name** --- that is used to describe a design problem, the solution and the consequences.
- **The problem** --- that describes when we need to apply the pattern, explaining the problem and its context.
- **The solution** --- that describes the elements that make up the design, the relationships, the responsibilities and collaborations. The solutions do not describe a concrete implementation, because a pattern is like a template which can be applied in many different situations, but provides an abstract description of a design problem and how a general arrangement of elements (classes and objects) solves it.
- **The consequences** --- that are the results of applying the pattern.
