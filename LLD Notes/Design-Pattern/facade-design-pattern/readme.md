- Façade pattern is different from adapter pattern because façade simplifies a class structure while adapter keeps the same class structure.
- The Façade pattern is a way to structure our API into subsystems to reduce ever growing size and complexity of interfaces of API.

### Facade Pattern
Intent
- Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
