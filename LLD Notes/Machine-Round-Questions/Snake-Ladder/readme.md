In this implementation of Snake and Ladder game in C++, several data structures and algorithms are used:

- Arrays: to store positions of players, snakes, and ladders.

- Vectors: to store a list of players, snakes, and ladders.

- Random Number Generation: to generate random dice rolls.

- Search Algorithm: to check if a player landed on a snake or ladder.

- Comparison Algorithm: to check if a player has won the game.
