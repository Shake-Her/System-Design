- An online shopping system like Amazon is a software application that allows customers to purchase goods and services over the internet. The system typically includes a user-friendly interface for browsing and searching products, a shopping cart for adding and removing items, and a checkout process for placing an order and making a payment. The system also includes features for tracking order history and status, managing account information, and tracking shipping status. 

- To ensure a successful implementation, the system must meet both functional and non-functional requirements, such as performance, security, scalability, usability, reliability, compatibility, and maintainability. The system can be built using various programming languages, C++ being one of them.

### Functional Requirements for Online Shopping System

Some examples of functional requirements for an online shopping system include the following:

1.  The ability to browse and search for products
2.  The ability to add items to a shopping cart
3.  The ability to place an order
4.  The ability to make a payment
5.  The ability to view order history and status
6.  The ability to manage account information
7.  The ability to track the shipping status of an order
8.  The ability to receive an order confirmation

### Non-Functional Requirements for Online Shopping System

Some examples of non-functional requirements for an online shopping system include the following:

1.  Performance: The system should be able to handle a high volume of traffic and transactions without significant delays.
2.  Security: The system should protect customer data and transactions from unauthorized access.
3.  Scalability: The system should be able to handle an increase in traffic and transactions without significant degradation in performance.
4.  Usability: The system should be easy to navigate and use for customers.
5.  Reliability: The system should be reliable and always up and running with minimal downtime
6.  Compatibility: The system should be compatible with different web browsers and devices.
7.  Maintainability: The system should be easily maintainable and adaptable to changing requirements.

Code Explanation
----------------

This code defines a few classes that are used to model a simple e-commerce application. The classes include:

1.  Product: A class representing a product with a name, description, price, and stock level. It has a constructor, getters, and setters for its properties and an operator overload for equality comparison.
2.  ShoppingCart: A class that represents a shopping cart. It has a vector of products, a constructor, methods to add and remove products, and a method to calculate the total cost of the items in the cart.
3.  Customer: A class representing a customer with a name, address, and email. It has a constructor, getters, and setters for its properties and also an operator overload for equality comparison.
4.  Inventory: A class that represents an inventory. It has an unordered map of products with an integer representing the stock level. It has methods to add and update products and check if a product is in stock, and a method to restock a product.
5.  Payment: A class that represents a payment with an amount and a payment method. It has a constructor, getters, and setters for its properties.

The code also defines some customizations to the standard library, like the hash function and equal_to function for the Product class, that allows it to be used as a key in unordered_map.

### The code uses several data structures and algorithms:

1.  Class Product: This class represents a product and contains its name, description, price, and stock level. It also overloads the == operator and defines a hash function and an equal_to function in the std namespace to enable it to be used as a key in an unordered_map.
2.  std::vector in class ShoppingCart: This class uses a vector to store the products in the cart. The addProduct method adds a product to the vector, and the removeProduct method removes a product from the vector.
3.  std::unordered_map in class Inventory: This class uses an unordered_map to store the products in the inventory, with the product as the key and the stock level as the value. The addProduct method adds a product to the map, the updateStock method updates the stock level of a product, the isInStock method checks if a product is in stock, and the restock method restocks a product.
4.  STL Iterator in class ShoppingCart: removeProduct method uses an iterator (auto it) to traverse the products in the vector and find the product to be removed.
5.  Overloading the operator in class Customer, Product: Both classes overload the == operator to compare the equality of two objects.
